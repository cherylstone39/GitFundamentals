#git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you wan tot keep, you'll need to tuse the 'git add' command.

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you can get away with the command "git add .' which will add All files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using 'git add file1 file2' which will track specifically file1 and file2.

You can specify tracking directories with 'git add DirectoryName'.
